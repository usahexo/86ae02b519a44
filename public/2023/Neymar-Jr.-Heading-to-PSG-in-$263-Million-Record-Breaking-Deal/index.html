        <h1 id="Neymar-Jr-Heading-to-PSG-in-263-Million-Record-Breaking-Deal"><a href="#Neymar-Jr-Heading-to-PSG-in-263-Million-Record-Breaking-Deal" class="headerlink" title="Neymar Jr. Heading to PSG in $263 Million Record-Breaking Deal"></a>Neymar Jr. Heading to PSG in $263 Million Record-Breaking Deal</h1><p>Neymar Jr. will be joining Paris Saint-Germain in a shocking $263 million deal, making him the most expensive player in history. The Brazilian superstar’s move comes just days after his former club Barcelona announced they were ready to start negotiations for the 25-year-old.</p>
<p>The transfer fee smashes the current world record of $222 million set by Paul Pogba when he moved from Juventus to Manchester United last year. Neymar’s contract is also reported to be worth a staggering $55 million per year, making him the highest-paid player in the world.</p>
<p>Paris Saint-Germain have been desperate to sign Neymar for some time and are believed to have finally met his release clause. The French club’s owner, Nasser Al-Khelaifi, has confirmed the deal is now done and that Neymar will be presented as a PSG player on August 3rd.</p>
<p>Barca are said to be furious at losing their star player and have accused Neymar of breaking his contract with the club. They are now demanding that PSG pay a $26 million bonus which was negotiated into Neymar’s contract when he signed for them in 2013.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Neymar has caused controversy with his transfers. In 2013 he moved from Brazilian club Santos to Barca in a deal worth $76 million, which was then a world record transfer fee. This move was also met with criticism as many people felt he was overpriced and had not yet proved himself as one of the best players in the world.</p>
<p>However, Neymar quickly silenced his critics by scoring 105 goals in 186 games for Barca and helping them win La Liga, the Copa del Rey and Champions League titles. He was also part of the Brazilian team who won Olympic gold in 2016.</p>
<p>Neymar’s move to PSG will no doubt provoke further debate about whether or not footballers are overpaid and whether their astronomical salaries are justified. However, there is no doubt that Neymar is one of the most talented players in the world and his skills will be a huge asset to PSG as they look to win Europe’s biggest prize.</p>
<h1 id="Neymar-Money-to-be-Spent-on-More-Star-Players-by-PSG"><a href="#Neymar-Money-to-be-Spent-on-More-Star-Players-by-PSG" class="headerlink" title="Neymar Money to be Spent on More Star Players by PSG"></a>Neymar Money to be Spent on More Star Players by PSG</h1><p>Paris Saint-Germain are eyeing up moves for Chelsea duo Eden Hazard and Thibaut Courtois, according to reports.</p>
<p>Le10 Sport say the Ligue 1 side are set to splash out around €220 million (£196 million) on the pair as they look to build a squad capable of winning the Champions League.</p>
<p>That would take PSG’s spending on players this summer to over €430 million (£386 million), with Neymar’s world-record transfer from Barcelona already having been completed.</p>
<p>And it seems the money is not about to stop there, with club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi ready to break the bank in order to bring in some of Europe’s top talent.</p>
<p>Hazard has been linked with a move away from Stamford Bridge for some time now, with Real Madrid believed to be leading the race for his signature.</p>
<p>But PSG could prove to be a tempting alternative for the Belgian international, with the chance to work with Neymar and Kylian Mbappe an offer he may find hard to refuse.</p>
<p>As for Courtois, he is thought to be considering his future at Chelsea after failing to secure a regular starting spot last season.</p>
<p>The former Atletico Madrid goalkeeper is likely to be number one choice at PSG, where he would team up with another Belgium international in Thomas Meunier.</p>
<h1 id="Could-This-Spell-the-End-for-Monaco’s-Champions-League-Aspirations"><a href="#Could-This-Spell-the-End-for-Monaco’s-Champions-League-Aspirations" class="headerlink" title="Could This Spell the End for Monaco’s Champions League Aspirations?"></a>Could This Spell the End for Monaco’s Champions League Aspirations?</h1><p>Monday’s 1-1 draw with Marseille in the Stade Vélodrome could have potentially fatal consequences for Monaco’s chances of playing Champions League football next season.</p>
<p>The principality side are now four points behind fourth-placed Lyon, who have a game in hand, and seven adrift of third-placed Marseille. With just six games remaining, it is looking increasingly likely that Monaco will miss out on Europe’s top club competition for the first time since 1998&#x2F;99.</p>
<p>It has not been a good couple of months for Monaco, who were knocked out of the Coupe de France by minnows Le Havre in late February and lost 2-1 at home to Lyon last weekend. Manager Leonardo Jardim has come under increasing pressure, with some supporters calling for his resignation.</p>
<p>The Portuguese coach has come under criticism for his negative tactics, as well as his team selection and substitutions. He also controversially left Radamel Falcao on the bench against Lyon, only bringing him on in the second half when the home side were 2-0 up.</p>
<p>Monaco may have had some decent results this season - they have beaten PSG, Arsenal and Manchester City - but their overall performances have not been good enough. They have conceded too many goals and created very little going forward.</p>
<p>Their best player this season has undoubtedly been Kylian Mbappé, but even he has not been at his best recently. The 18-year-old attacker was taken off at halftime against Lyon and looked a shadow of the player who scored twice against Manchester City in the last 16 of the Champions League.</p>
<p>Jardim must find a way to get his team back on track if they are to salvage anything from this disappointing season. He needs to find a system that works and select players who are willing to fight for the jersey. And most importantly, he needs to start winning games again.</p>
<h1 id="Manchester-City-vs-Paris-Saint-Germain-Clash-of-the-Titans"><a href="#Manchester-City-vs-Paris-Saint-Germain-Clash-of-the-Titans" class="headerlink" title="Manchester City vs. Paris Saint-Germain: Clash of the Titans"></a>Manchester City vs. Paris Saint-Germain: Clash of the Titans</h1><p>The stage is set. On Tuesday, February 12th, Manchester City will host Paris Saint-Germain in the second leg of their UEFA Champions League Round of 16 matchup. This has all the makings of a classic David vs. Goliath battle, as Pep Guardiola’s reigning Premier League champions take on the French powerhouse led by world-class striker Neymar.</p>
<p>Manchester City comes into this match after beating Schalke 04 3-2 in the first leg of their knockout round tie. The Citizens got off to a shaky start, conceding two goals in quick succession in the first half. However, they managed to mount a comeback in the second half, with goals from Leroy Sané and Raheem Sterling securing their victory.</p>
<p>Paris Saint-Germain, on the other hand, had an easier time in their first leg matchup against Real Madrid. The Ligue 1 champions won 2-1 thanks to goals from Kylian Mbappé and Edinson Cavani. This result gives them a slight edge heading into the second leg at the Etihad Stadium.</p>
<p>Both teams come into this match with plenty of firepower up front. In addition to Neymar, PSG also boasts the likes of Mbappé and Cavani, while Manchester City has Sergio Agüero and Sterling. This should lead to an exciting match full of goalscoring opportunities.</p>
<p>Prediction: Manchester City 3 – 2 Paris Saint-Germain</p>
<h1 id="How-Will-PSG-Use-Neymar-Jr-Predictions-for-2017-x2F-2018-Season"><a href="#How-Will-PSG-Use-Neymar-Jr-Predictions-for-2017-x2F-2018-Season" class="headerlink" title="How Will PSG Use Neymar Jr.? Predictions for 2017&#x2F;2018 Season"></a>How Will PSG Use Neymar Jr.? Predictions for 2017&#x2F;2018 Season</h1><p>It isn’t a secret that Neymar Jr. is one of the best players in the world. The Brazilian superstar has some impressive stats, including 186 goals and 116 assists in 314 appearances for club and country. When it comes to European football, Neymar has scored 52 goals in 77 appearances.</p>
<p>Naturally, when a player of this caliber becomes available, top clubs around the world take notice. In fact, Neymar was the most sought-after player in the 2017 summer transfer window. Ultimately, he decided to join Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) for a world record fee of €222 million ($263 million).</p>
<p>Now that he’s officially joined PSG, all eyes are on how he will be used by new manager Unai Emery. So far, there have been mixed signals about how Emery plans to use Neymar. On one hand, Emery has said that Neymar will be his “primary striker.” On the other hand, Neymar himself has said that he doesn’t want to be pigeonholed as a striker and would like to play in multiple positions depending on the game situation.</p>
<p>So how will Neymar be used by PSG during the 2017&#x2F;2018 season? Let’s take a look at some possible scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Neymar is used as a primary striker – In this scenario, Neymar plays as the main striker and occupies defenders by running at them with speed and dribbling skills. He would also try to get into scoring positions and shoot or pass to teammates who are in better scoring positions. This would likely lead to more goals for PSG; however, it could also leave them exposed defensively if Neymar gets injured or tired.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Neymar plays as an attacking midfielder – In this scenario, Neymar plays just behind the main striker(s). He would be tasked with creating chances for teammates and scoring goals himself. This would give PSG more attacking firepower and could lead to more goals scored overall; however, it may also leave them susceptible defensively if the opponents manage to close down Neymar and his teammates.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Neymar plays as a winger – In this scenario, Neymar plays on either flank and uses his speed and dribbling skills to attack defenders one-on-one. He would also look to provide crosses for teammates who are in better scoring positions. This could lead to more chances created and more goals scored; however, it could also leave PSG exposed defensively if they don’t have enough players back when defending counterattacks.</p>
</li>
</ol>
