The 5-4 ruling struck down the 1992 law, which had made it illegal for states to own or operate sportsbooks.</p>
<p>Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the majority opinion that the law violated the 10th Amendment by commandeering states to maintain its prohibition. “The fundamental problem with §1084 is that it violates the anticommandeering rule,” Alito wrote.</p>
<p>Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan joined Alito in the majority opinion. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Neil Gorsuch dissented.</p>
<p>Kennedy wrote in his dissent that the law should be upheld because it “promotes two important governmental interests: The preservation of order and a healthy gaming industry.”</p>
<p>The ruling clears the way for states to legalize and regulate sports betting. New Jersey has been attempting to do so since 2011, but has been blocked by the federal government. Delaware, Nevada, and Montana were exempt from the federal ban as they had already legalized some forms of sports betting before 1992.</p>
<p>Monday’s ruling was a major victory for New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, who campaigned on legalizing sports betting. “I’m thrilled today’s decision will finally allow New Jersey residents to benefit from the economic opportunity that legalized sports betting will bring,” Murphy said in a statement. “I thank our attorneys for their hard work on this case and I look forward to working with the Legislature to enact a law authorizing and regulating sports betting in New Jersey.”</p>
<p>Murphy is expected to sign legislation authorizing sports betting within days of the ruling.</p>
<h1 id="College-Athletes-Can-Now-Get-Paid-To-Play"><a href="#College-Athletes-Can-Now-Get-Paid-To-Play" class="headerlink" title="College Athletes Can Now Get Paid To Play"></a>College Athletes Can Now Get Paid To Play</h1><p>On Monday, the NCAA announced that it will allow universities to compensate their student athletes up to $5,000 per year in addition to the cost of attendance. This new rule goes into effect on August 1 and allows for each university to decide how to distribute the money among its athletes.</p>
<p>The NCAA has been grappling with this issue for years, as many college athletes argue that they should be able to earn a salary like other students. In fact, a recent lawsuit from a group of former college athletes challenging the NCAA’s prohibition on player compensation is currently pending in federal court.</p>
<p>The new rule does not change the fact that college athletes are not allowed to be paid salaries by their universities, but it does allow them to receive additional benefits such as scholarships, room and board, and now cash payments. It’s unclear exactly how much money each university will choose to give its athletes, but the NCAA estimates that the average scholarship will increase by $2,000 per year as a result of this new rule.</p>
<p>There has been some backlash against the new rule, with some people arguing that it amounts to “paying players” and that it will create an unfair advantage for schools who can afford to pay their athletes more than others. However, others argue that this is a step in the right direction and that it is finally time for college athletes to be treated fairly.</p>
<p>What do you think about the NCAA’s decision to allow universities to pay their student athletes? Is this a good step forward or is it wrong for colleges to pay players? Let us know what you think in the comments below!</p>
<h1 id="University-Of-Nevada-Las-Vegas-Opens-First-Sportsbook-On-Campus"><a href="#University-Of-Nevada-Las-Vegas-Opens-First-Sportsbook-On-Campus" class="headerlink" title="University Of Nevada Las Vegas Opens First Sportsbook On Campus"></a>University Of Nevada Las Vegas Opens First Sportsbook On Campus</h1><p>The University of Nevada Las Vegas is no stranger to gambling. It is, after all, home to the infamous “Blackjack School” that has taught countless aspiring card sharks how to beat the house for more than 30 years. </p>
<p>But this week, UNLV took its love of wagering to a new level with the opening of its first sportsbook on campus. The facility, which is located in the heart of the student union, offers a variety of betting options for fans of college and professional sports.</p>
<p>“This is something that our students have been clamoring for,” said UNLV spokesperson Terri Begley. “We’re excited to be able to provide them with a one-stop shop for all their gambling needs.”</p>
<p>The sportsbook is operated by William Hill, one of the largest and most respected gaming companies in the world. It features 14 televisions, four self-service betting stations, and a full-service bar.</p>
<p>Students were lining up around the block on Wednesday morning to get their first glimpse of the new sportsbook. Many expressed excitement at finally having a place on campus where they could bet on games legally.</p>
<p>“I’ve been waiting for this since I came to school here,” said 18-year-old freshman Joshua Powers. “I can’t wait to start making some money.”</p>
<p>William Hill officials say they are expecting big things from their new venture in Las Vegas. They predict that the sportsbook will become one of the busiest venues on campus, with crowds of avid gamblers making their way through its doors each day.</p>

<p>While it is unlikely that anyone will correctly predict all 63 games in the tournament, there are definitely opportunities to make some money if you know where to look.</p>
<p>One way to potentially make some money off of the tournament is by betting on games. There are a variety of ways to bet on college basketball, and the odds vary depending on the game.</p>
<p>For example, as of March 14th, Paddy Power was offering odds of 5&#x2F;1 on University of North Carolina winning the tournament. If you were to bet $10 on Carolina and they won, you would earn $50 in return.</p>
<p>Another way to make some money off of the NCAA Tournament is by picking players for your bracket pool. Typically, pools will have a variety of different payouts based on how many people correctly guessed the winner of the tournament.</p>
<p>For example, Yahoo!’s bracket pool offers prizes for first place ($1 million), second place ($500,000), third place ($250,000), fourth place ($100,000), fifth place ($50,000), and sixth through tenth places (each winning $25,000). So even if you don’t correctly predict the champion, there are still opportunities to win some money.</p>
<p>Of course, there are other ways to make money off of the NCAA Tournament as well. For instance, some office pools will charge an entry fee, and then give out prizes to the winners. Others may have a betting pool in addition to a bracket pool.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that there are plenty of different ways to make some extra money during March Madness - you just need to be creative and think outside the box. So get your bracket ready and good luck!</p>
