        <h1 id="America-Leads-the-Way-in-GTAN-Online-Gambling"><a href="#America-Leads-the-Way-in-GTAN-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="America Leads the Way in GTAN Online Gambling"></a>America Leads the Way in GTAN Online Gambling</h1><p>America continues to lead the way in all types of gambling, and GTAN online gambling is no exception. A recent study by the research firm H2 Gambling Capital found that Americans account for more than half of the global online gambling market.</p>
<p>Not only are Americans more likely to gamble online than people from any other country, but they also tend to gamble more often and lose more money. In 2017, American gamblers lost a total of $24.6 billion dollars online, more than twice as much as British and Chinese gamblers combined.</p>
<p>So what is it about America that makes us so drawn to gambling? There are a few possible explanations.</p>
<p>For one, America has always been a nation of risk takers. We were some of the first people to gamble on stocks and try our luck at casino games like blackjack and roulette. And with the advent of online gambling, we’ve only become more daring, risking ever larger sums of money in pursuit of big payouts.</p>
<p>Another reason may be that America is a very individualistic society. We value independence and self-reliance, which may lead us to be less afraid to take risks in order to get ahead. Gambling can be seen as a way to achieve financial independence, and many people are drawn to it for that reason.</p>
<p>Finally, America is a very consumer-driven society. We love buying things, and we’re always looking for new ways to make money. Gambling can be seen as just another form of entertainment—one that can be potentially very lucrative if you’re lucky enough to hit it big.</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons may be, it’s clear that America is leading the way in global online gambling—and shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.</p>
<h1 id="Europe-Shows-Strong-growth-in-GTAN-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Europe-Shows-Strong-growth-in-GTAN-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Europe Shows Strong growth in GTAN Online Gambling"></a>Europe Shows Strong growth in GTAN Online Gambling</h1><p>The year 2016 has been a prosperous one for the European gambling industry, with a number of jurisdictions showing strong growth in online gambling. Particularly GTAN countries – such as Italy, Spain and Portugal – have seen notable expansion in the market, thanks to a combination of liberalized regulations and innovative marketing strategies.</p>
<p>Italy has been a particularly notable success story, with online gambling revenues growing by over 20% in 2016. This can be partially attributed to the fact that the country offers one of the widest ranges of legal online gambling products in Europe, including sports betting, poker and casino games. In addition, operators have been aggressive in targeting the Italian market, with many offering bonuses and promotional deals specifically aimed at local players.</p>
<p>Spain has also seen healthy growth in its online gambling market, with revenues up by almost 15% in 2016. This is largely thanks to a new licensing system which came into effect in 2015, which has allowed a number of new operators to enter the market. Poker is particularly popular in Spain, accounting for almost 60% of all online gambling revenue.</p>
<p>Portugal has also seen strong growth in its online gambling sector, with revenues up by almost 20% in 2016. The main drivers behind this growth have been the country’s well-regulated market and its popular casino games. Portuguese players are particularly fond of slot machines, accounting for over 60% of all revenue from casino games.</p>
<p>Overall, it is clear that GTAN countries are leading the way when it comes to European online gambling growth. This is likely due to a combination of liberalized regulations and effective marketing strategies, which have made these markets more attractive to players and operators alike.</p>
<h1 id="Asia-Continues-to-Dominate-GTAN-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Asia-Continues-to-Dominate-GTAN-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Asia Continues to Dominate GTAN Online Gambling"></a>Asia Continues to Dominate GTAN Online Gambling</h1><p>Asia Pacific continues to be the dominant market for GTAN (Global Texan Hold’em) online gambling, according to research released by analysts at Juniper Research. The study found that the region accounted for 62% of all global online GTAN gambling revenue in 2016, with a forecast that this would grow to 70% by 2021.</p>
<p>This growth is being driven by markets such as China and South Korea, where there is a strong cultural affinity for online poker and other card games. In China, for example, a number of major gaming companies are based around GTAN tournaments, with millions of dollars in prize money on offer.</p>
<p>The US market is also growing quickly, but still lags behind Asia in terms of revenue. This is due in part to the fragmented nature of the market, with different states having their own regulatory frameworks and player pools. As a result, there are a number of smaller operators who are able to thrive in this environment.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Asian market is largely dominated by a small number of large operators. This has led to concerns among some industry observers that the market could become saturated in the coming years. However, given the continued growth in key markets such as China, it seems likely that Asia will remain the dominant force in GTAN online gambling for some time to come.</p>
<h1 id="South-America-Shows-Promise-in-GTAN-Online-Gambling"><a href="#South-America-Shows-Promise-in-GTAN-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="South America Shows Promise in GTAN Online Gambling"></a>South America Shows Promise in GTAN Online Gambling</h1><p>GTAN, or Greater Than All Nations, has long been a hotbed for online gambling. Often considered the most important market in the world for online casinos, the region has seen steady growth in recent years. But with new markets opening up elsewhere in the world, some experts were wondering if South America was falling behind.</p>
<p>A recent report from Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming seems to dispel those concerns, however. The study found that the Brazilian and Argentinean online gambling markets are both growing rapidly and are expected to be among the largest in the world by 2020. This is good news for casino operators, who stand to make significant profits from these booming markets.</p>
<p>What’s driving this growth? In a word: millennials. This tech-savvy generation is leading the charge in Latin America when it comes to online gambling. They’re comfortable using their smartphones and other devices to place bets, making them a coveted target for casino operators. And with so many young people in Latin America, there’s plenty of room for growth.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking to expand your online casino into South America, now is definitely the time to do it. The Brazilian and Argentinean markets are both primed for explosive growth, so get in while the getting’s good!</p>
<h1 id="GTAN-Online-Gambling-Booming-Worldwide"><a href="#GTAN-Online-Gambling-Booming-Worldwide" class="headerlink" title="GTAN Online Gambling Booming Worldwide"></a>GTAN Online Gambling Booming Worldwide</h1><p>The global online gambling market is booming, with a value estimated to be worth $51.96 billion by the end of 2020. This growth is being driven by the increasing popularity of mobile devices and the expanding availability of online gambling services.</p>
<p>A report released by Technavio predicts that the global online gambling market will grow at a CAGR of more than 9% during the period 2018-2020. The increasing demand for digital entertainment and rising disposable incomes are some of the key factors contributing to this growth.</p>
<p>The global online gambling market is segmented into five categories: sports betting, casino games, poker, bingo, and lottery. Of these, sports betting is the largest segment, accounting for more than 38% of the overall market in 2020. Casino games are the second-largest segment, accounting for nearly 30% of the market.</p>
<p>Regionally, Europe is the largest market for online gambling, accounting for more than 43% of the global market in 2020. This is followed by North America (27%) and Asia Pacific (21%). The growth in North America is being driven by the increasing legalization of online gambling in countries such as the US and Canada.</p>
<p>The leading players in the global online gambling market are William Hill plc (UK), Ladbrokes Coral Group plc (UK), Paddy Power Betfair plc (Ireland), MGM Resorts International (US), and Caesars Entertainment Corporation (US). These companies are investing heavily in developing new products and expanding their distribution networks to tap into the growing demand for online gambling services.</p>
