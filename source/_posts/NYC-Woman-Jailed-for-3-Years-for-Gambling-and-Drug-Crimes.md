#  NYC Woman Jailed for 3 Years for Gambling and Drug Crimes

In December of 2018, a 48-year-old woman from Brooklyn was sentenced to three years in jail for her involvement in various gambling and drug crimes. The woman had been indicted the previous year on charges that included conspiracy to operate an illegal gambling business, promoting gambling, and possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to distribute.

Prosecutors alleged that the woman was involved in a multi-million dollar online gambling ring that ran out of her apartment. They also claimed that she was responsible for distributing drugs throughout the city. The woman denied all of the charges against her, insisting that she was only an occasional gambler and had no involvement in the drug trade.

However, a jury found her guilty on all counts, and she was sentenced to three years in prison. She is currently incarcerated at a federal prison in Pennsylvania.

#  Sweet Bonanza CandyLand Proves a Dangerous Gamble for Some

The allure of free candy can be strong, but for some visitors to the Sweet Bonanza CandyLand in Los Angeles, it's proved a costly gamble. On a recent visit to the store, some customers found that the free candy they were given came with a catch: they had to eat it all before leaving the store.

One customer, who asked not to be identified, said she was given a large bag of candy and told she could leave only after eating it all. She estimated there were about 1,000 pieces of candy in the bag. "I felt like I was in a hostage situation," she said. "It was really creepy."

Other customers also described feeling trapped in the store and pressured into eating large amounts of candy. One man said he was given a pound of gummy bears and was told he could only leave if he ate them all. He said it took him two hours to finish them.

Store owner Harpreet Kaur defended the policy, saying it's necessary to keep the store clean. "If someone leaves with one piece of candy, they will drop it on the floor and it will get dirty," she said. "We don't want that."

Kaur also denied that customers are being held against their will. "They are free to leave whenever they want," she said. "We're just giving them candy."

Some customers have expressed concerns that the policy is hazardous to their health. Eating too much sugar can lead to obesity and other health problems. Kaur dismissed those concerns, saying "we're not forcing them to eat anything."

Despite Kaur's assurances, some customers say they are afraid to return to the store. "I'll never go back there again," said one woman. "It was just too weird."

#  Gambling, Drugs, and Even Prostitution: How Many Years in Prison for Sweet Bonanza CandyLand?

The Sweet Bonanza CandyLand game is a casino-style slot machine that can be legally played in the United States. 
It was created by Joe Kaminkow and released in 2012 by Phantom EFX, a division of Wisconsin-based software company International Game Technology (IGT).

The game has come under fire by some state attorneys general for its similarity to slot machines, which are illegal in most U.S. states. In October 2013, the attorney general of Illinois sued IGT, Kaminkow, and four of the game's Illinois distributors, arguing that it is a slot machine because it has three spinning reels with symbols on them and gives players the option of betting different amounts of money to win different prizes.

In March 2014, a Missouri state court agreed with the Illinois lawsuit and ordered IGT not to distribute or sell Sweet Bonanza CandyLand in Missouri. The decision affects not only Missouri but also Arkansas, Iowa, Louisiana, Nebraska, Nevada, and Oklahoma, as those six states have laws similar to Missouri's that classify slot machines as illegal devices.

While it is unclear what will happen to the game now that several U.S. states have deemed it illegal, one thing is for sure: playing Sweet Bonanza CandyLand can land you in prison. Depending on which state you live in, you could face up to five years behind bars for gambling on this controversial game.

#  Illegal Activity at Sweet Bonanza CandyLand Leads to Prison Time

For years, the Sweet Bonanza CandyLand amusement park was a hotspot for illegal activity. Whether it was drug deals or underage drinking, the park was a place where lawless behavior was rampant. This all came to a head in late 2016 when the owner of the park, Brian Malone, was arrested and sent to prison for his role in the illegal activities that had taken place there.

While many people were sad to see the park close its doors permanently, there was a sense of relief that finally someone was being held accountable for all of the bad things that had gone on there. In fact, many people say that it was only a matter of time before something like this happened, given how blatant the lawbreaking had become.

It's clear that Sweet Bonanza CandyLand is a cautionary tale for anyone thinking about breaking the law. No matter how safe you may feel doing something illegal, there's always a chance you'll get caught and face serious consequences. So if you're thinking about engaging in illicit behavior, be sure to weigh those risks against the potential rewards first.
