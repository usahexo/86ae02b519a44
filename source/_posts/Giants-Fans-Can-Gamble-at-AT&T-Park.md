#  Giants Fans Can Gamble at AT&T Park

This year, Giants fans attending games at AT&T Park can gamble on site. The ballpark has partnered with the Golden Nugget to offer in-park sports betting.

Fans will be able to place bets at kiosks throughout the park, as well as on their phones. The Golden Nugget is the official casino partner of the Giants and the team's stadium.

San Francisco is the latest city to allow in-game sports betting. Other cities that have made this move include New York and Philadelphia.

The Giants are hoping that this new development will help increase attendance at their games this season. The team had the lowest attendance in Major League Baseball last year.

#  Giants and 49ers Make it Legal to Gamble at Levi's Stadium

The San Francisco 49ers and New York Giants are the latest NFL teams to make it legal to gamble on-site at their stadiums.

The Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California will now have a sportsbook inside, and the MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey is also close to finalizing an agreement for a sportsbook.

This means that there are now six out of the 31 NFL stadiums that offer some form of gambling, with three more likely to come online in the near future.

This is a major step forward for the NFL as a whole, as it allows for more fans to engage in activities that they are already interested in.

It also provides another stream of revenue for teams, as they can now earn money from bookmakers through sponsorship deals and other marketing agreements.

#  Bay Area Casinos Battle for Gambling Dominance 

The Bay Area may soon be home to two major casinos, as developers clash over who will get the green light to build. The projects are in different stages of development, but both promise to bring jobs and tourism dollars to the area.

The first casino is being planned for the East Bay city of Richmond. The project has already been approved by the Richmond City Council, and the developers are now waiting for state approval. If given the go-ahead, construction could start as early as this summer.

The Richmond casino would be owned by the Penn National Gaming company, which already operates a number of casinos across the country. The proposed casino would have a gaming floor of around 100,000 square feet, with 1,500 slot machines and 50 table games. It would also include a hotel, restaurant, and entertainment venue.

Supporters say that the casino will create 1,000 jobs and generate $25 million in annual tax revenue for Richmond. Opponents argue that the casino will cause crime and social problems in the community.

A proposal for a second Bay Area casino is also making its way through the approval process. This casino would be built in San Jose, near the HP Pavilion sports arena. The project is being developed by the Las Vegas-based Pinnacle Entertainment company, and it has already been given unanimous approval by the San Jose City Council.

The San Jose casino would be much larger than the Richmond proposal, with a gaming floor of 300,000 square feet and 3,000 slot machines. It would also include a hotel, conference center, and restaurant. Pinnacle estimates that it will create 2,500 jobs and generate $100 million in annual tax revenue for San Jose.

Like the Richmond project, there are opponents to the San Jose casino who worry about its potential negative impacts on the community. Some residents are concerned about increased traffic and noise from visitors to the casino. Others worry about increased crime rates and gambling addiction problems.

So far there is no timeline for when either of these casinos might open their doors to customers, but each step in the approval process takes us one step closer to seeing them become reality. In a region starved for jobs and economic growth, these casinos could be just what we need to jumpstart our economy –– with or without all of the side effects included.

#  Reno Becomes the Gambling Capital of the West 

The city of Reno, Nevada was founded in 1859 by a group of pioneers from California. At the time, the area was known as “Big Meadows,” and it was chosen as the site for a trading post to supply travelers on the California-Oregon Trail. The city’s name is derived from Reno Station, a stop on the Central Pacific Railroad line that ran from Sacramento to Reno.

Reno quickly grew into a thriving commercial center, thanks in part to its location near the Comstock Lode, a major silver deposit. In 1871, Nevada became a state, and Reno was designated as its capital. But the city’s prosperity was short-lived; when the silver boom went bust in 1882, Reno’s economy collapsed.

The city rebounded in the early 20th century, this time thanks to its status as a gambling destination. Gambling had been legalized in Nevada in 1931, and casinos began popping up in Reno. The city’s casino industry really took off during World War II, when military personnel stationed at nearby bases started spending their free time gambling in Reno casinos.

Since then, Reno has become known as the “Gambling Capital of the West.” The city is home to several major casinos, including Circus Circus Hotel & Casino, Eldorado Resort Casino, and Silver Legacy Resort Casino. It also hosts several major gaming tournaments each year, including the World Series of Poker and the World Championship of Online Poker.

Reno is also a popular tourist destination for those looking to enjoy its outdoor activities. The city is located at the base of Mount Rose Ski Resort, and it offers plenty of opportunities for hiking, biking, fishing, and skiing
