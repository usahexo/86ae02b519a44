#  Rupert Murdoch to Sell Lord of the Rings Slot Machine

According to Deadline, Rupert Murdoch is planning to offload the rights to Lord of the Rings slot machines. The deal, said to be in the region of $250 million, would see the slot machines go to a consortium including MGM and Anschutz Entertainment Group.

The timing of the sale couldn't be better, with the huge success of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films fresh in people's minds. A spokesman for Murdoch confirmed that the decision had been made to sell, but declined to give any further details.

Interestingly, this wouldn't be Murdoch's first foray into the world of gambling; he already has a controlling stake in Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut. The new deal would see him team up with MGM, who have plenty of experience when it comes to running casinos.

Anschutz Entertainment Group are no strangers to big deals either; they're responsible for some of the biggest venues in the world, including London's O2 Arena and Los Angeles' Staples Center. It's not yet clear what their plans are for Lord of the Rings slot machines, but you can expect them to be ambitious.

MGM have been on something of a spending spree recently, with big-name acquisitions such as "The Hobbit" and "21 Jump Street". They're clearly keen to make a splash in the casino industry, and Lord of the Rings could be just what they need.

The only question now is whether or not Jackson will get involved? He was famously critical of Gladiator slots – which were produced by Foxwoods – so it's unclear whether he'll want anything to do with this new project.
