#  The Baccarat Tournament is Coming to Orwell! 

Orwell, a small town in the center of the United States is getting ready to host its first baccarat tournament! The game, which is believed to have originated in Italy in the 15th century is a popular casino game that is now being offered as a tournament.

The tournament will be held at the local casino, and participants can sign up online or in person. There is a $50 entry fee, and the top three players will share the $1,000 prize pool. The tournament will begin on September 1st and run through October 31st.

So what is baccarat? It is a game that involves betting on either the player or the banker. The player has two options – to bet on the player’s hand or to bet on the banker’s hand. The banker has one option – to bet on the banker’s hand. The object of the game is to get as close to nine points as possible. Points are counted with cards worth face value with an ace counting as one point and a two through nine counting as their face value. Tens and face cards (jack, queen, king) are worth zero points.

If you bet on the player and they get a total of eight or nine points, you win automatically. If they get anything else, it goes to a “third card rule” which decides whether or not they get another card. If you bet on the banker and they get a total of eight or nine points, you also win automatically. If they get anything else, it goes to a “third card rule” just like with the player bets.

The third card rule states that if either the player or banker have a total of six or seven points after their second card, then their opponent gets another card. If either side has five points or less after their second card, then their opponent does not get another card. So if you are playing against someone who gets third card rule applied to them, there is still hope!

Baccarat can seem like a complicated game but it can be fun and exciting once you understand how it works! Be sure to come out to Orwell for our first baccarat tournament!
