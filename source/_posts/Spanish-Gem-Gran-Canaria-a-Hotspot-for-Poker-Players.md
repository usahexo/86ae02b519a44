#  Incredible Full Houses at the Poker Tables in Gran Canaria

Some of the poker rooms in Gran Canaria have an interesting peculiarity: they offer full houses. This is possible because they are configured with six tables, of which only five are used for playing. The sixth one is used as a buffer and can be occupied by any player who loses a hand.

The room at the Riviera Resort has been enjoying this feature for some time now, as has the PokerStars Room in the Hotel Hesperia Tower. What's more, the Palacio de Congresos also offers this service during its tournaments.

Players who come to Gran Canaria specifically to play poker and who don't want to spend hours waiting for a seat at a table now have a variety of alternatives available to them. They can either choose one of the full houses offered by the casinos or take part in one of the many tournaments on offer throughout the week.

"Poker players love to come to Gran Canaria because it's always sunny and warm," says Vicente Delgado, owner of the Pokeralia Club in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. "Players can enjoy some great sunbathing during the day, and then play some poker at night under the stars."

The Pokeralia Club is located right on the beach in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and offers live tournaments every day from 6pm to 2am. There's also a generous cash game schedule that runs from 10am until 6am. In addition to poker, the club also offers food and drinks service for players.

The PokerStars European Poker Tour (EPT) has visited Gran Canaria twice in the past, and both times the tournaments were sold out. The next EPT stop will be in Barcelona in April 2018, but there's already talk about returning to Gran Canaria later this year.
