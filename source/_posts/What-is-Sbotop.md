#  Why don't you answer my questions?

It's frustrating when you ask someone a question and they don't answer. You may feel ignored, dismissed, or even disrespected.

There can be many reasons why someone might not answer your questions. They may be busy, or they may not know the answer. They may also be avoiding your question for some other reason.

If you feel like the person you're talking to is ignoring you, there are a few things you can do. First, try to rephrase your question. Sometimes people don't understand what you're asking them. Or, if you're communicating in writing, make sure your questions are clear and concise.

If the other person still doesn't respond, you can try politely reminding them that you're waiting for an answer. You can also ask them if they're okay and see if there's something else going on that's preventing them from answering your questions.

If none of these approaches work, it's possible that the other person just doesn't want to talk to you. In that case, it might be best to walk away and find someone else to talk to.
