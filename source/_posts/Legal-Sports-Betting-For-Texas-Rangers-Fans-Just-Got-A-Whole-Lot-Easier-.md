#  Legal Sports Betting For Texas Rangers Fans Just Got A Whole Lot Easier 

As of Wednesday, September 5, 2018, the pending case against the state of Texas by the Professional Baseball Athletic Trainers Society (PBATS) and the Texas Rangers has been dismissed. This is great news for fans of the Rangers who love to engage in legal sports betting on their favorite team. 

The PBATS had argued that a 1992 state law that prohibits betting on "amateur or professional sports contests" included baseball, even though Major League Baseball is a commercial enterprise. However, Judge Robert Pitman of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas ruled that "the law only prohibits gambling on the outcome of a sporting contest and not gambling relating to any individual participant in that contest." This ruling thankfully allows legal sports betting on baseball in the state of Texas and opens up new opportunities for fans to make some extra money on their favorite team.

While this is great news for Rangers fans specifically, it also has implications for fans of all major league teams across the United States. This is because other states with similar laws may now also be open to legal sports betting on baseball, as well as other sports. This will likely result in an increase in legal sports betting activity throughout the country and could lead to greater revenues for both state governments and professional sporting leagues.

There is no question that this recent ruling is a big win for both Rangers fans and fans of other major league teams nationwide. With so much at stake, it will be interesting to see how things play out in terms of increased legal sports betting activity in light of this decision.

# You Can Now Legally Bet On Texas Rangers Games In Minnesota 

The Minnesota Twins announced on Monday that they had reached an agreement with the Texas Rangers to legalize sports betting on their games at the state’s two casinos. The Twins are the first team to partner with a casino since the US Supreme Court struck down a law that banned sports betting in most states in May. 

The Twins will get a small cut of the money wagered on their games, and the casino operator will also pay the team for marketing and data rights. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. 

The move is seen as a way to attract more fans to Twins games, as well as to generate new revenue for the team. Casinos in Minnesota had been offering bettors legal wagers on other teams’ games, but not on those of the Twins. 

“This is another great opportunity for our organization to reach out to new and existing fans, while also creating additional revenue,” said Dave St. Peter, president of the Twin Cities-based baseball team. 

Legalized sports betting has been growing rapidly in popularity since it was made legal in a number of states last year. In May alone, $1.9 billion was wagered on sports in Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey and West Virginia, all of which have recently legalized sports betting.

#  New Legislation Allows For Sports Betting On The Texas Rangers in Minnesota 

Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota has announced a piece of legislation that will allow for sports betting on the Texas Rangers in the state. This new legislation is seen as a major win for the state, as it is expected to bring in millions of dollars in revenue that can be used to fund critical projects.

The Governor released a statement saying, "This new legislation is about giving Minnesotans the opportunity to engage in a pastime that they love, while also generating much-needed revenue for our state. I'm proud to support this bill, and I look forward to seeing it passed by the legislature and signed into law."

As of now, it is unclear exactly how much money this new legislation will generate for Minnesota. However, experts estimate that it could bring in anywhere from $10 million to $30 million per year. This would be a huge boon for the state, as it currently faces a budget shortfall of $1.5 billion.

In order to place a bet on the Texas Rangers in Minnesota, residents will need to go to one of the newly-licensed casinos or sportsbooks in the state. It is still unclear which casinos will offer sports betting, but officials say that they will likely be located near the Twin Cities metro area.

Minnesota isn't the only state considering legalizing sports betting on professional teams. In fact, several other states are currently debating similar bills. For example, New York is considering allowing sports betting on all professional teams, while Michigan is focusing on legalizing betting on college games only.

It's unclear whether or not these other states will follow Minnesota's lead and legalize betting on specific teams. However, if enough states do legalize team-based bets, it could lead to a large increase in overall gambling revenues.
