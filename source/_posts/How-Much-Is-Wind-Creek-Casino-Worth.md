#  How Much Is Wind Creek Casino Worth?

The value of a casino, like any business, is determined by how much profit it generates. In the case of a casino, this comes from the difference between what it pays out in winnings and what it takes in from players in the form of bets.

In 2017, Wind Creek Casino generated $236 million in revenue. After paying out $183 million in winnings, that left it with a net profit of $53 million. If we assume that this profit is distributed evenly among the casino’s shareholders, that would give each one a stake worth just over $1 million.

But this figure doesn’t take into account the cost of building and running the casino. These expenses can be significant, and so it’s not unreasonable to think that the casino’s owners might be seeing a return on investment of only around 10%. This would reduce each shareholder’s stake to around $100,000.

This is still a healthy return, but it’s important to remember that casino profits can vary quite a bit from year to year. So if you’re thinking about investing in one, it’s best to do your research first to see how its performance has been historically.

#  Slot Machines Pay Out Nearly Half A Billion In Atlantic City

Slot machines in Atlantic City have generated nearly half a billion in payouts so far this year, new data released by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement shows.

The state’s casinos took home $480,547,853 from slot machines from January through September this year. That’s up 3 percent from the same period last year.

Bally’s Casino led the pack with $118.5 million in winnings, followed by Caesars Atlantic City with $107.1 million and Tropicana Casino and Resort with $97.7 million.

Slot machines account for roughly two-thirds of casino revenue in Atlantic City, which is currently in the midst of a years-long renaissance following several casino closures starting in 2014.
