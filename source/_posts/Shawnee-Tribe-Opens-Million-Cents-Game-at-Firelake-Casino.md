#  Shawnee Tribe Opens Million Cents Game at Firelake Casino

The Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma opened its $1,000,000 Cents Game at the Firelake Casino on Feb. 1. The game is a high-stakes slot machine with a top prize of $1 million.

“The new game is another example of how the Shawnee Tribe is working to provide our tribal members with unique gaming opportunities that are both fun and rewarding,” said Chad Hulbert, chairman of the Shawnee Tribe Gaming Commission.

The new game offers players the chance to win big prizes on penny bets. Players can bet up to $10 per spin on the game and have a chance to win progressive jackpots that range from $5,000 to $1 million.

Firelake Casino is one of two casinos owned and operated by the Shawnee Tribe. The tribe also operates a casino in Grove, Oklahoma.

#  Tribal Members Can Play for a Chance to Win up to $1 Million

In an effort to increase tribal membership, some tribes are now offering the chance to win up to $1 million.

The Comanche Nation in Oklahoma is one tribe that is currently running this promotion. Members of the tribe who play the casino’s new Million Dollar Slot Machine can win a share of the $1 million prize pool.

Randy Toby, CEO of the Comanche Nation Entertainment Corporation, explained that the promotion is a way to show appreciation to the tribe’s members. “We just want to give back to our people, and what could be better than giving away a million dollars?” he said.

Other tribes with similar promotions include the Tunica-Biloxi Tribe of Louisiana, the San Carlos Apache Tribe in Arizona, and the Pueblo of Laguna in New Mexico.

There are some restrictions on who can participate in these promotions. Typically, you must be a member of the tribe and at least 18 years old to qualify. Some tribes also have residency requirements.

If you are lucky enough to win a prize, there may be some taxes owed on it. The Internal Revenue Service taxes gambling income at a rate of 25%. Depending on your state of residence, you may also owe state taxes on your winnings.

#  Gaming Floor Boasts Hundreds of New Games

The casino gaming floor has been completely overhauled with hundreds of new games. There are now forty-six blackjack tables, seven craps tables, four roulette wheels, and more than two hundred and fifty slot machines.

“We’re really excited about the new gaming floor,” said casino manager Jackie Wilkins. “It’s been a long time since we’ve made such a large investment in our gaming products. We think our guests are going to love it.”

In addition to the new games, the casino has also installed a new high limit area. This area is designed for guests who want to enjoy a more luxurious gambling experience. It features private cocktail service, plush furniture, and state-of-the-art gaming terminals.

The casino is also offering several promotions to celebrate the launch of the new gaming floor. These include free play offers, dining discounts, and hotel stays. Guests can find out more about these promotions at the casino’s website or by talking to a customer service representative.

The casino gaming floor is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

#  Firelake Casino Welcomes Dancing Fans with New Flooring

The Dancing with the Stars Live! tour is coming to Firelake Casino on Saturday, February 10 and the casino is excited to welcome fans with new flooring. The show will be held in the Grand Ballroom, which is newly outfitted with a floating maple dance floor.

“The new flooring is absolutely beautiful,” said Firelake Casino Marketing Director Misty Mora. “It’s going to make the show even more spectacular. We can’t wait for fans to experience it.”

The Dancing with the Stars Live! tour features professional dancers from the popular television show who will lead audience members in dance routines. The tour has been popular across the country, and Mora expects a sell-out crowd at Firelake Casino.

To ensure that guests have a great experience, the casino has made several other upgrades in preparation for the show. In addition to the new flooring, remodeled dressing rooms are now available for use by dancers and crew. A green room has also been created to provide a place for cast members to relax before and after their performances.

In addition to the Feburary 10 show, Dancing with the Stars will also be appearing at Firelake Casino on July 14 and 15. For more information or tickets, visit firelakecasino.com or call (405) 964-7263.
