#  Who else was involved in the game?

Besides the two teams playing, a few other people are typically involved in a game. There are referees or umpires who officiate the game and make calls, as well as announcers who provide commentary on the game. In recent years, there has been an addition to the sidelines - cheerleaders. 

Cheerleaders are often female and perform stunts and dances in order to encourage the fans of their team. They can also be used to taunt or distract the opposing team. Cheerleaders are especially common in sports like football and basketball, but can be found in other sports as well.

Referees are responsible for making calls during the game, such as fouls or violations. They also enforce the rules of the game and can issue penalties to players or teams. Referees wear uniforms that typically distinguish them from both players and fans.

Announcers provide commentary on the game, usually describing what is happening as it happens. They may also give analysis of players or teams after the game is over. Announcers typically work for TV or radio stations, and may be employed by one team or another depending on their bias.

#  What do the winnings mean for Mexico?

Mexico was celebrating after their national team beat the Netherlands in the World Cup. This victory meant that Mexico had advanced to the next round of the tournament, and they were feeling confident about their chances of winning the World Cup.

But what do the winnings mean for Mexico?

In addition to having a chance to win the World Cup, advancing to the next round also means that Mexico will be earning more money. Each team in the World Cup is guaranteed a certain amount of money, regardless of how far they advance in the tournament.

For teams that are eliminated in the group stage, this amount is $8 million. But for teams that make it to the next round, this amount increases significantly. For teams that make it to the semi-finals, this amount increases to $12 million. And for teams that make it to the finals, this amount increases to $18 million.

So while Mexico may not have won the World Cup yet, they are already earning more money than they would have if they were eliminated in the group stage. This increase in earnings could mean great things for Mexico’s economy, as it could help to stimulate economic growth and development.

#  What's next for Mexico and the game?

The Mexican national team just experienced one of the most heartbreaking defeats in their history, as they were eliminated from the World Cup in Russia by Sweden. This article will look into what's next for Mexico and the game.

First and foremost, it is important to credit Sweden for playing a great match and advancing to the round of 16. El Tri were unlucky not to get a few more goals, but Sweden defended well and took advantage of their opportunities.

Now that the World Cup is over for Mexico, all attention will turn to the new manager who will be in charge of qualifying for the 2022 World Cup. There are many candidates for the job, but some of the favorites include Tata Martino and Diego Simeone. Whoever gets the job will have their work cut out for them, as Mexico are currently in danger of not qualifying for the World Cup.

There are also many questions surrounding players like Javier "Chicharito" Hernandez and Guillermo Ochoa. Chicharito has been a mainstay on the Mexican national team for many years, but his recent lack of playing time at West Ham raises question marks about his future with El Tri. Ochoa has been one of Mexico's best players in recent years, but he has also been struggling with club football lately. It will be interesting to see if either player is able to revive their careers before the next World Cup qualifiers begin.

In conclusion, there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding Mexico's future both on and off the pitch. However, there is still plenty of time for things to change before qualifying begins for the 2022 World Cup.
